# DSA | Logic Building | Problem Solving

## ðŸ“… Daily Java Practice Repository
**Started on: April 12, 2025**

### ðŸš€ Overview

This repository is dedicated to my daily practice in four core areas of Java & Problem Solving:

- âœ… **Java Collection Framework**
- âœ… **Java Concurrency**
- âœ… **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**
- âœ… **Logic Building / Problem-Solving**

To organize and version my learning journey, Iâ€™ve set up this repository with a **branch-per-topic** structure:

- `collection` â†’ For Java Collection Framework
- `concurrency` â†’ For Java Concurrency aka multithreading concepts and problems
- `dsa` â†’ For classic DSA problems and patterns
- `logic` â†’ For pure logic-building challenges
- `main` â†’ Merged progress from all branches, including daily logs

### ðŸ“Œ Workflow

1. Every day, I work on the respective topic branches (`collection`, `concurrency`, `dsa`, `logic`).
2. After completing the day's practice:
    - I commit the changes to the corresponding topic branches.
    - Then I merge all updated branches into the `main` branch.
    - I document my learning and progress in the daily journal section below.
3. This helps me to improve:
    - My Git & GitHub proficiency
    - Code documentation and commit hygiene
    - Problem-solving consistency
